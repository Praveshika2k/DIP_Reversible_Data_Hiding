# Reversible Data Hiding using Histogram-Based Difference Expansion for QR Code Applications

## Abstract

This project implements a reversible data hiding technique leveraging histogram-based difference expansion for secure information embedding within QR code images. The approach is designed to preserve image fidelity while allowing the embedded data to be perfectly retrieved and the original image restored, making it suitable for confidential document handling, watermarking, and QR code-based applications. Developed with a student-focused and modular structure, the code offers real-time usability and hands-on experimentation. The implementation draws upon the methodology proposed in the referenced base paper, adapting it for educational and practical needs.

## Base Paper Reference

**Title:** Reversible data hiding with histogram-based difference expansion for QR code applications

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- OpenCV  
- Matplotlib  
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  
- Other standard Python libraries

## Steps to Execute the Code

1. Open the project notebook file: [DIP_J_component_code.ipynb](https://github.com/Praveshika2k/DIP_Reversible_Data_Hiding/blob/main/DIP_J_component_code.ipynb) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Ensure required libraries are installed or use Colab's pre-installed packages.
3. Run each cell in sequence following the instructions provided in the notebook.
4. When prompted, input your own image (QR code or others) for embedding data.
5. Observe the data hiding, recovery, and image reconstruction steps with clear outputs.

## Description of Dataset

This project achieves versatility by allowing users to input their own images and messages directly for the data hiding process. You can experiment by uploading any QR code or standard image and specifying the hidden message during runtime. This design encourages active learning and exploration.
